# Retail-Anomaly-Detection

Objective: 

Develop a comprehensive system to detect anomalies in retail sales data. This will involve data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and deployment. The goal is to identify unusual sales patterns that could indicate potential issues such as data entry errors, fraud, inventory problems, or unexpected market behaviour.
